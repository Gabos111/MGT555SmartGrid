# MGT555SmartGrid

In this Project we are Planning to implement a Decision Making Algorithm that chooses eather we take the energy from the Grid or not.

1. Test how can we connect Python and ARDUINO and turn on the LEDS

------------------------------------Decision Making Algorithm----------------------------------------------

Optimize how we charge the batteries that we will swap:

INPUTS:

- Energy Prices : CHF per kWh
- Solar Energy : kWh ( comparer le cout de l'energie renouvelable!!)
- Batteries Status of Charge in Room 1

OUTPUT:

- Takes Power from : Grid || Energy Storage room
- Charge Storage Room : YES or NO ( Predict)

Optimize the use of the swapping room batteries
